Summary of bug:Fixed issue where licence plates with 7 or more chars/number without any whitespaces or hyphens were considered valid which is wrong. The code is fixed to consider them non-valid.

Expected behaviour: returning false

Actual behaviour: returning true (before fixture)

Steps to Reproduce: Added one conditional check to force such licence plates to be considered non-valid before starting with other checkups. The condition added is: 

"if (input.length() >= 7 && !input.contains(" ") && !input.contains("-")) return false;"

Severity: Meduim
